# Data Mining
Data Cleaning, Querying and Visualization with Pandas DataFrame.

### Description
This project is intended to prepare six months of Airbnb Athens data for queries. Pandas DataFrames are incredibly versatile and are appropriate for a wide range of tasks involving data. They provide a rich set of tools to perform data cleaning and preprocessing and also make it easy to calculate descriptive statistics. They work seamlessly with most machine-learning and visualization Python libraries. The project is divided into two Jupyter(.ipynb) notebooks containing both the code and explanations of each step.
